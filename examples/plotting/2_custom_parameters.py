# to change once the image is produced.

# This example demonstrates how to use some of these options. In particular,
# we consider how one might visually represent node voltages in a large crossbar
# array where using default parameters produces a diagram with nodes that are
# hard to see without zooming in.

# wanted to have a better global view of how the voltages are distributed.
