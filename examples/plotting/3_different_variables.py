# The main purpose of the plotting module is for plotting currents and voltages
# in the branches and on the nodes of the crossbar, respectively. However,
# these functions can accept any numeric arrays and thus plot arbitrary
# variables. This example shows how to plot the percentage change in current
# in every branch, due to introduced line resistance.
